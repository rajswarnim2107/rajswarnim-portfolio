Entity Aware
 Query Retrieval
 (Hotel Search)
Designed and implemented a search with modular query-resolution pipeline that extracts key entities and dynamically switches between entity-first parsing and LLM-powered hybrid search
Led a full overhaul of the hotel search architecture to improve precision and relevancy for complex, multi-entity queries, serving 500k users daily
Focused on surfacing the right properties for users, even when queries were overly complex


Multi-modal RAG
 for CX agents 
Designed and implemented an assistive CX bot (using RAG) trained over thousands of SOPs 
Performed context engineering from direct sources, for relevant answers to a customer
Developed a robust SOP ingestion pipeline building a complete knowledge base
Boosted response accuracy from 55% to 66% and cut chat resolution time from 17 min to ~6 min


Personalisation & Recommendation (Hotels)

Product Observability & Anomaly Detection Platform
Designed and developed a near-real-time observability/anomaly detection system monitoring 10K+ daily business and technical metrics to detect outages.
Led a cross-functional team to implement forecasting-based anomaly detection with injection validation, achieving ~94% detection accuracy and low false positives.
Slashed incident triage TAT from days to minutes, mitigating downtime risks and safeguarding business continuity.


Real Time Flight Search Cache Predictor
Build a dynamic cache for Flights for better cache utilisation and to reduce price change 
Contributed in building a streaming pipeline to ingest millions of flight searches and preemptively populate cache with LookAhead, ensuring fresh, relevant pricing.
Applied parametric survival models to forecast user search behavior, boosting cache utilization by 32–35% and cutting P95 latency from 4 s to <1 s
Drove ~2.2 k incremental daily bookings and over ₹1 MM in daily margin uplift through timely, data-driven cache refreshes.
